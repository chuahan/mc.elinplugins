## Welcome to the Magical Music Mod, also known as the Bard Mod.

[h1]Adds the Bard archetype playstyle to Elin.[/h1]
Those with musical prowess can now use special bard instruments to cast bardic magic.
This mod aims to provide an alternative support playstyle in Elin for you.
Taking on the Bard archetype in fantasy games, you gain access to a variety of bard magic that provide buffs and debuffs in battle.

[h1]Key Notes[/h1]

[h2]Bard Magic[/h2]
Unlike normal spells, the cost of Bard Magic is time. Bard Magics are all channeled, meaning you must invest several turns and be in relative safety in order to cast it.
This makes the bard a backline character, meaning it is highly recommended you have a party that will protect you while you prepare the spells.
You also must have a specific "bardic instrument" to use. This mod adds 15 different bard instruments for you to use.

Bard magic is divided into 3 categories.
Verses - Your main buff and debuff spells.
Choruses - Less time to cast, minor utility spells, and attack spells.
Finale - Your ultimate spells that can be performed once you hit 10 Rhythm stacks, and will consume all of your Rhythm, scaling its effect based on the amount consumed.
These are quite powerful bard spells and usually will turn the tide of battle, but due to their Rhythm requirement, cannot be cast as often, so plan out when you will need this power.

[h2]The Rhythm Buff[/h2]
As you perform multiple bard spells in a row, you will gain the Rhythm buff that has a stack counter.
You can increase the stacks by casting Choruses after Verses, or Verses after Choruses, forcing you to mix things up a little. You can have up to 30 stacks.
Gaining stacks will refresh the duration of the Rhythm buff. The Bard Instrument you last used to cast any Bard Magic will change your Motif.
Hover over your Rhythm to see what your current Motif is, as your Motif will determine which Finale you cast.

[h1]Getting Started[/h1]
The first thing you will need to do to get started is to find yourself an instrument and some spells.
Niyon, a harvin musician, can be found in Palmia. If you have enough musical aptitude (Level 10 Music Skill), she will be your introductory mentor to bard magic.
Talking to her will get you your first instrument and set of songs to start using. As you level up those spells, check back on Niyon from time to time, she might have more to offer.
Learning from her will start your journey on Bard Magic, and also will unlock the ability to learn from another mentor.

[h1]Unique NPCs[/h1]
This mod adds two Unique NPCs to help teach you bard magic. They are both recruitable through dialog quests. You will need to befriend both of these NPCs in order to unlock all the bard abilities.

Mystic Musician Niyon - A harvin musician hailing from the sky realm finds herself settling in the city of music.
Niyon operates as your primary Bard tutor, in charge of teaching you more buff-focused bard Magic, as well as selling you more Bardic Instruments.
Niyon operates as a support character, casting her own tailored Bard Magics to support you and your team in battle.

Pianissimo Selena - A construct hailing from Earth finds herself in Ylva, settling in the city of art and magic.
Selena operates as a secondary Bard tutor, in charge of teaching you more debuff-focused Bard Magic.
Selena is a bard, but operates more offensively, preferring to attack enemies instead. She generates Rhythm on skills and can consume Rhythm to empower her abilities.

[h1] Character Origins [/h1]
Niyon the character and the some of her icons used in this mod are from the game Granblue Fantasy by Cygames.
Selena the character and some of her icons used in this mod are from the game Punishing Gray Raven by Kurogames.
Homura the song used for the Farewell and Gratitude of Flames Finale is by LiSA.

[h1] Compatibility [/h1]
This mod works with existing save files.
This mod occupies identifiers in the 89xxx range. It also uses a few of the 140xxx identifiers from the BlackSouls/GBF mod for some multiplier elements.

[h1] AI Content Warning [/h1]
This Mod Uses AI generated Content:
SunoAI was used to generate most of the songs (except for Homura.) You will hear a couple seconds of music unique to each Bard Ability or Finale. If you don't want this, just go to the config and set UseMusic to false.
The Preview Art was generated via AI with text slapped ontop of it.

[h1]Balance Warning[/h1]
Gonna be 100% Honest. I'm not great with balance scaling. This mod adds over 40 new abilities, some offensive, some defensive. I do want to try and scale these properly,
but with how Elin goes completely off the rails at higher levels, I'm not sure what is a safe way to scale those.
If you have balance suggestions, please add a comment here or even reach out to me on the Discord.

[h1] Requirements [/h1]
This mod requires the [b]Custom Whatever Loader[/b] mod.

[h1] Please report any bugs here or on the Elin Discord @ the Pinned FAQ guy.[/h1]

[h1]Changelog[/h1]
- Initial Release. Bugs highly probable. Please reach out if you find any bugs.

[h1]Plans[/h1]
- Probably aiming to add a 3rd NPC for more bard magic. They will likely be focused more on actually attacking spells and utility spells (non combat)
- Depends on how many bugs I find and need to fix first.
- If people really want it, I can make Niyon's abilities available to the player (Ninna Nanna, Qualia, and Defendu), but you have access to better scaling versions of them already.
- If people really want it, I can make Selena's attack abilities available to the player (Flaming Chord, Thunderous Transposition, and Rhythmic Piercing), but they are heavy Rhythm consumers as Selena usually generates Rhythm slower than the player. So I'm not sure if it's really desirable.
- Depends also on the progress of the next mod.
