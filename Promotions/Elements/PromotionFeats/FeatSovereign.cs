/// A king is no king without his people, but a people without their king would be lost as well. The Sovereign is a frontline leader that is as much a tactician as they are a warrior.
/// Sovereigns focus on observing the battle and commanding their forces as the situation sees fit with their commands and aura.
/// They specialize in the use of Law and Chaos Stances and the subsequent Orders to change the flow of battle.
/// 
/// All Orders are on a Cooldown of 10 Turns and will last 10 turns.
/// Skill - Law Stance - When Law Stance is in play. Defensive Orders will be given. In addition, all allies within 5 radius will take 10% reduced damage.
///     Will deactivate Chaos Stance.
/// Skill - Chaos Stance - When Chaos Stance is in play. Offensive Orders will be given. In addition, all allies within 5 radius will deal 10% increased damage.
///     Will deactivate Law Stance.
/// Skill - Morale Orders - To Victory! / To Death!
///     - Law: Increase to all Attributes, Life, Mana, and SP.
///     - Chaos: Speed Increase, Increase Casting/Combat skills.
/// Skill - Strategy Orders - Rally to me / Rout the Enemy!
///     - Law: Burst heals allies, gives them Protection, then slowly regenerates their HP / MP.
///     - Chaos: Allies gain Holy Intonation, Vorpal. When characters under Rout order make a kill they recover 10% of their MP and SP, as well as restore charges of their intonation if possible.
/// Skill - Formation Orders - Barricade Formation / Sword Formation
///     Coherency will link allies to their own minions or other allies.
///     - Law: When allies suffer damage, the damage is reduced by 5% per neighboring friendly that is also in Formation.
///     - Chaos: When allies make a Melee attack or Ranged Attack, one ally in Formation will try to make a ranged or melee attack followup.
///         The follow-up attack can only happen once per turn.
