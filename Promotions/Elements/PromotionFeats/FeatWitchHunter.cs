/// Suffer not the heretic. Witch Hunters have decided they really hate mages, and will go through any means to see them gone.
/// Witch Hunters focus on hunting down casters with their anti-magic in combat.
/// They specialize in being the absolute nightmare of any mage on the field through massive spell resistances and anti-casting abilities.
/// Skill - Mana Break - Causes a Magic Damage Explosion that deals damage based on how much mana the target is missing.
/// Skill - Magic Reflect - Activates reflective magical shield that redirects an incoming magical spell at the caster.
/// Skill - Null Zone - The caster gains Null Zone for 10 turns.
///     All characters within 5F of the Null Zone are afflicted with Spell Null, which will set cast chance to 0% for any spell.
///     30 Turn Cooldown
/// Passive - Bane of Magickind
///     In additon to Excommunication, Bane inflicts Silence.
///     When the Witch Hunter inflicts damage, 10% of the damage done is mana damage.
